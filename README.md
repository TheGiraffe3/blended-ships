## Corporations

This plugin adds two new corporations so far: Greenrock Shipyard Ltd. and Sirius Carcinogenics Corporation. The first is a legitimate company based on Greenrock that in no way endorses or supports pirates. The second, however, is a complete joke. They run a small shipyard on Relic where they produce the Grackle, a thoroughly insane ship.
